# Mushroom Classification and Prediction Model
A model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using a logistic regression algorithm.

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The analysis and model creation were documented in the provided PDF file, which outlines the process and results.

## Dataset
The dataset includes attributes like cap shape, cap color, gill size, etc. It is used to train the model to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** KNIME
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and the solution PDF.
2. Review the solution PDF for details on the analysis and model.
3. Use KNIME or Python to replicate the workflow described.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy rate of 75%, effectively distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.

## Future Work
- Exploring other machine learning models for better accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset for more diverse mushroom types.

## Note
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes, showcasing data science skills and techniques.
